# Description
  Ride-sharing website that connects users with identical destinations in the Colorado area. The website allows users to browse information on various hiking landmarks and ski areas.  Information for hiking spots may include the length of the hike, terrain, level of difficulty, and altitude. Information for ski areas may include snow depth, snow type (packed powder, powder, etc.), and ticket costs.  
  Users can put in their chosen destination with a planned date of travel and the website will match with other travelers.  Drivers and passengers can create groups. Users can chat with their group to plan the trip.  To facilitate cost-sharing, the website calculates gas cost and share-per-passenger given vehicle information.


# Architecture: 
- The technologies to be used on the back-end include Express.js, and MongoDB which gets rid of using overly complicated SQL queries.
- The technologies to be used on the front-end include react, materialize-CSS, and HTML.
- The front-end and back-end will communicate with each other using the handlebars API of Express.js.
- React will be responsible for the behavioral and state storage part of the website, materialize-CSS for styling, MongoDB as the database, and Express.js as an API for communication between back-end and front-end.
