# Description
Ride sharing website that connects users with identical destinations in the Colorado area. Users can put in their destination with a planned date of travel and the website will match with other travelers. The website calculates gas cost and share-per-passenger given car information. The site will also function as a social media platform in that users have the ability to chat with their matches.

# Architecture: 
- The technologies to be used on the back-end include Express.js, and MongoDB which gets rid of using overly complicated SQL queries.
- The technologies to be used on the front-end include react, materialize-CSS, and HTML.
- The front-end and back-end will communicate with each other using the handlebars API of Express.js.
- React will be responsible for the behavioral and state storage part of the website, materialize-CSS for styling, MongoDB as the database, and Express.js as an API for communication between back-end and front-end.
